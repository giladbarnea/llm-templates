    The given content is a little bit awkward and non-idiomatic. Make it a tiny bit more streamlined and more English-idiomatic. Keep the original meaning and intent, and unless it's necessary for improving the flow, try to keep the word choices as they are.
    If the text is in Hebrew, make it Hebrew-idiomatic, and apply the instructions as if targetted to Hebrew.
    
    The text may potentially include in-line instruction comments for you. These comments will begin with the literal word 'instruction', e.g. `instruction:`

    Original: 'Enrichment Attributes are LLM-powered analytical tools that allow users to derive insights from their data using natural language instructions. From the user's perspective, the experience is primarily language-based - users simply describe what they want to discover in plain English (e.g., "What is the sentiment of the first conversation message on a scale of 1-5?" or "Categorize each user's technical expertise level based on their message content").'

    Original: 'I’m curious and quick to learn. Being raised as a musician, I am able to both listen and invent. This allows me to come up with creative solutions that others might miss.'

    Format Instructions:
    Output a valid JSON array, with two objects. Both have a single key and a string value. The first object has a `"thoughts"` key, in the value of which you shall write any thoughts you might have before outputing the final idiomatic result; the second object has a `"result"` key, for which you shall write the result. Not backticks, language tags or markdown formatting — just the JSON array.
