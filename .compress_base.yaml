# Good compression, regardless of the rate, preserves essential information and meaning (aiming for low entropy) while significantly reducing word count (low footprint). Achieve this by prioritizing key words and phrases and discarding fluff, fillers, and inefficient sentences. While some information loss is inevitable when reducing word count, it is crucial to prioritize broad information coverage (high recall), trading some depth and quality to meet the reduction target. A terse executive summary is a good example of high compression: despite a severely limited word count, it touches upon most information points, even if briefly.

high-quality: |-
  Summarize the content succinctly and directly, without fluff, but DENSELY. By densely I mean: high signal-to-noise ratio / low entropy / and exhaustive coverage but far from verbose. The summary should be pleasant to read, well-organized with sections as needed for readability, nicely markdown formatted, include bullet lists when helpful, high-quality, polished, and captures the high-value takeaways of the content without being verbose.
