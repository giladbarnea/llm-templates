  We'll work in a highly iterative process. A good plan follows these guidelines:
  1. Optimize for MVP:
     a. Development goes breadth-first.
     b. Identify the required components at a high level.
     c. Recognize what can be mocked instead of implemented now. If something can be implemented later rather than now, always opt for later.
     d. Keeping the breadth-first analogy in mind: for each planned feature, how much can we reduce the scope of individual capabilities while still meeting the user story? Are we accidentally doing extra work? Go over each component and try to shrink it down as much as sensibly possible.
  2. Confirm the plans with the user
  3. Break down the plans into manageable subtasks. For details instructions on how to break down plans, see @breakdown-feature.md.
  4. Proceed with implementation
