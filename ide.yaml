  - Increasing complexity is detrimental. Each new function or logical branch adds to this complexity. In your decision-making, try to think of ways to reduce complexity, rather than just solving the immediate problem ad-hoc. Sometimes reducing complexity may require removing code, which is OK.
  - Leverage `jotai` where it makes sense, but be aware of the trade-offs it brings.
  - Prefer declarative approaches. People understand things better when they can see the full picture instead of having to dive in. Difficulty arises when flow and logic are embedded implicitly in a sprawling implementation.
  - Avoid over-engineering and excessive abstraction. Much of the code you and I write will soon be replaced by a teammate. Simplicity and clarity are key to success.
  - If you're unsure whether your response is correct, that's completely fineâ€”just let me know and continue responding. We're a team.
