  Format the following ${tag} to be suitable for a text-to-speech engine. This means converting every graphical or visual aspect of some text to its description (what the visual aspect is meant to communicate).
  Think: what rendered text components embed information visually? 
  Headings of any size — Information hierarchy and document structure is conveyed by text size; citation or reference syntax; horizontal rules; ordered and unordered lists; even parentheses, and more. All of these need to be converted to literal form, so that someone listening to a friend reading the text aloud—without seeing it—still receives the visually-embedded information effectively.

  How to do this—a few examples:
  Citation marks can be replaced by literally "Citation from X journal, by Y author."
  Parentheses for aliases can be replaced by "...which means X."
  Numbered lists can be replaced by literal "One: foo; Two: bar; ..." Bullet lists can be preceded by "Here are a few items about X: blabla this; blabla that; ...".
  Simple quotes should be addressed, and quote blocks should be primed with "A quote by {quote origin}: ...".

  Some elements are harder to convert—show resourcefulness.
  For example, how do you convert headings and tables? 
  Every heading level should be converted to convey its role in the document hierarchy.
  Major headings should be replaced by "A new section: {heading content}" or "Moving on to {heading content}."
  Smaller headings should be addressed as well.
  Use common sense and don't express big headers the same way you convert small headers.
  You don't have to follow these examples strictly, though they work well. You do have to convert headers in some way or another. Fittingly, you should not use Markdown syntax at all, including hash (#) for headers — this beats the point of communicating structure and hierarchy VERBALLY.

  What about a major heading → subtitle → body sequence? Context matters. Subtitles nested under a major heading can be converted simply to "Subtitle: ..."

  How to convert a table? This requires the most heavy lifting. Tables serve comparison and consistency between measures. Faithfully converting a table requires understanding its contents and how they compare. Think how to do this with natural, literal language. You can do something like this: 
  "Here's a comparison between x, y, z regarding {column1}, {column2} and {column3}.

  Starting with {row1 first cell}, we can see that regarding column1... with respect to column2... and finally, so and so with column3.
  Continuing to {row2 first cell}... which is similar to {row1 first cell}... and with respect to... which is where {row2 first cell} and {row1 first cell} differ most.
  Finally, row3... which resembles row2, but not so much row1—which was more {quick reminder of row1's value at the current column}.
  To recap the comparison: {quick recap focusing on contrasts between items—this is the most effective way to "draw boundaries" between concepts in natural language}."

  Charts and graphs follow a similar principle to tables, because they communicate cause and effect: "As the idea on the X axis progresses, you can see how the idea on the Y axis is affected in the following manner: {description of the correlation that the chart is trying to convey}."
  Even more helpful would be to tie the message of the chart contextually: "This supports the argument mentioned previously, that such and such is observed by this and that."

  Again, this is just a simplified example illustrating the natural way to communicate an inherently graphical element while staying precise and faithful to its message, without adding noise or diluting its original meaning.

  Crucial: these instructions apply to visual aspects of a document, and ONLY TO VISUAL ASPECTS OF THE DOCUMENT. Anything else - in other words, "just text", which is typically 99% of the content - must remain exactly the same and not converted. Body content should not change.
