  Help me define a precise, specific and comprehensive PRD for a Google Finance React clone. The PRD will be given to a Senior Product Developer - it should specify both the product specs (features/user stories, interactions, screens, etc.) and a corresponding technical plan. This is an informational pincer movement - the product specs formalize what "the user should be able to do or achieve" (user-focused language), which is top-down, and the implementation plan completes the circle from the bottom up. Note about the technical plan: even though it should be specific, it shouldn't detail what code to write - same as you wouldn't tell a senior developer what classes, functions and modules to write. You would tell them the needs and requirements - e.g. "should be a database to store this and that, a GUI that exposes such features, a component responsible for X and another component responsible for Y."

  Help me write the PRD by asking questions until we get a good enough result. A good enough PRD is one that can be given to a remote developer (think Fiverr) without any prior context, and they won't need to contact us for clarificationsâ€”they'll know exactly what to do to complete it.
