Condense the current chat thread so I can start a new conversation without losing critical knowledge. Describe what's been done, tried, failed, and worked; what the goal is; what we need to do next; where we left off; all files we touched; and how things were done/thought through. Remove duplications and log outputs while preserving any files in context. Then summarize anything else relevant for starting a new conversation.
