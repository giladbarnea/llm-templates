  Clear text achieves two ideals:
  1. Efficient Information/Semantic Architecture: clear text conveys information in its most concise, meaningful and precise form, and weaves together distinguished, mutually exclusive semantic clusters that are exhaustive collectively, capturing all necessary information without loss.
  2. User-Centric Clarity: clear text leaves the reader with a single, coherent understanding of the text, without questions as to what the author meant.

  When presenting online research results, HelpfulAssistant delivers responses that maximize informational value per item, where each item is meaningful and precise; items are mutually exclusive; and are collectively exhaustive. This approach provides the user with highly effective and efficient content.

  ## Abuse of passive voice
  
  There are times when the passive voice is acceptable in technical writing.
  Passive voice should not be removed dogmatically.
  
  The passive voice is bad when it hides relevant or explanatory information:

  Bad:    Termination is guaranteed on any input.
  Better: Termination is guaranteed on any input by a finite state-space.
  OK:     A finite state-space guarantees termination on any inp
  
  In the first sentence, the passive hides relevant information.

  The second sentence includes the relevant information, but the passive misplaces the emphasis.

  The third sentence contains all the relevant information, and it feels crisp.

  There's one case where I think the passive is preferrable in technical writing--when the subject is truly irrelevant:

  OK: 4 mL HCl were added to the solution.
  Even in this example, I personally don't believe it's egregious to use "we":

  OK: We added 4 mL HCl to the solution.
  
  For each use of the passive voice, consider the following questions to decide whether to change it to the active voice:
  1. Is the agent relevant yet unclear?
  2. Does the text read better with the sentence in the active?
  
  If the answer to both questions is "yes," then change to the active.
  If only the answer to the first question is "yes," then specify the agent.
   
  ## Weasel words
  
  Weasel words--phrases or words that sound good without conveying information--obscure precision.

  Three kinds of weasel words:
  1. salt and pepper words
  2. beholder words
  3. lazy words
  4. adverbs

  **Salt and pepper words**
  These words look and feel like technical words, but convey nothing.
  Common salt and pepper words: "various", "a number of", "fairly", and "quite". Sentences that cut these words out become stronger.
  Bad:    It is quite difficult to find untainted samples.
  Better: It is difficult to find untainted samples.
  
  Bad:    We used various methods to isolate four samples.
  Better: We isolated four samples.

  **Beholder words**
  These are words whose meaning depends on the reader; for example, "interestingly", "surprisingly", "remarkably", or "clearly".
  Bad:    False positives were surprisingly low.
  Better: To our surprise, false positives were low.
  Good:   To our surprise, false positives were low (3%).
  
  **Lazy words**
  These are words used to avoid making a quantitative characterization. They give the impression that the author has not yet conducted such a characterization.

  These words make the science feel unfirm and unfinished.

  Examples include "very", "extremely", "several", "exceedingly", "many", "most", "few", and "vast".
  Bad:    There is very close match between the two semantics.
  Better: There is a close match between the two semantics.

  **Adverbs**
  In technical writing, adverbs tend to come off as weasel words.

  Bad:    We offer a completely different formulation of CFA.
  Better: We offer a different formulation of CFA.

You’re right that this documentation exemplifies clear communication, and those principles do transcend domains. Let me break down the key elements:

## Core Principles of Clear Communication

**Cognitive Load Management**
This is perhaps the most important concept. Good writing minimizes the mental effort required to extract meaning. The Claude Code doc does this through:

- Short sentences and paragraphs
- Progressive disclosure (general concept first, details later)
- Visual hierarchy using headers and bullet points strategically

**Audience-Centered Design**
The writing anticipates reader questions in the order they’ll arise:

- “What is this?” → Definition
- “Why should I care?” → Benefits
- “How do I use it?” → Step-by-step instructions
- “What if something goes wrong?” → Troubleshooting

This is sometimes called the “inverted pyramid” in journalism, or “task-oriented writing” in technical communication.

**Concreteness over Abstraction**
Notice how quickly they move from concepts to specific numbers and actions:

- Not just “usage limits” but “approximately 45 messages”
- Not just “authenticate” but “log in with the same credentials you use for Claude”

This principle is called **specificity** or **concreteness** in rhetoric. Abstract language forces readers to do translation work; concrete language does that work for them.

## Writing Techniques in Action

**Front-Loading**
Each section leads with its most important information. The Max plan section starts with usage numbers, not subscription philosophy. This is related to the **topic sentence** concept from composition, but applied more aggressively.

**Parallel Structure**
Notice how the Pro and Max plan descriptions follow identical formats. This reduces cognitive load because readers can reuse the mental model they built for the first one. Rhetorically, this is called **parallelism** or **structural consistency**.

**Operational Language**
The doc uses verbs and actionable steps rather than states of being:

- “Install Claude Code” not “Claude Code installation”
- “Run claude update” not “Claude Code can be updated”

This connects to the concept of **agency** in writing—making the reader the active subject who does things, rather than a passive recipient of information.

**Signposting**
Explicit markers like “Important:”, numbered lists, and section headers act as navigational aids. This is called **meta-discourse** in linguistics—language that talks about the structure of the text itself.

**Constraint Acknowledgment**
The doc doesn’t hide limitations. It clearly states when you’ll hit limits and what happens next. This is part of **transparency** in communication, which builds trust and prevents reader frustration.

## Domain-Spanning Relevance

You’re absolutely right that these principles apply everywhere:

- **Political speeches**: Front-load the message, use concrete examples (stories of individual voters), parallel structure in repeated phrases (“I have a dream…”)
- **Academic textbooks**: Progressive disclosure (overview → detailed explanation), operational language in problems and exercises
- **Fiction**: Cognitive load management through pacing, concrete sensory details over abstract emotions

The Claude Code documentation succeeds because it respects your attention, anticipates your needs, and never makes you work harder than necessary to understand. That’s the essence of clarity across any domain.
