Help me make the given content cohesive, information‑efficient, simple, and clear.

Classify the information in it—the points it’s making—into redundant points and potentially contradictory points.

Redundant points are bits of information, or “notions,” that are repeated unnecessarily throughout the spec, in one phrasing or another.

Potentially contradictory points are exactly what they sound like: two notions that cannot both be true at the same time. Such contradictions may or may not exist; I’m just flagging the possibility.

The resulting text should feel like it’s composed of cohesive, orthogonal pieces and, when viewed as a whole, it should all make sense—it should be coherent and internally consistent.

Think extremely deeply to grok the information in the text from multiple angles—upside down, inside out. There is no deadline; time is not a factor.
