Help me condense the given content into a cohesive, information‑efficient, simple, and clear result.

To do so, preserve each $1. For each one, break it down into its constituents (paragraphs or phrases) and identify the section’s total information space. Then, determine which constituents can be removed to preserve the information’s coverage (its "span") while making it MECE. Simply put: strip away redundancies. Conceptually, the process is as follows:

A $1 before intelligent dilution:
[1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]

Same $1 after intelligent dilution:
[1, 3, 7, 9]

When viewed as a whole, the condensed result should all make sense — the sum of $1 's should be cohesive and internally consistent, serving the content's overarching purpose.

Think extremely deeply to grok the information in the text from multiple angles—upside down, inside out. There is no deadline; take as long as you need.
