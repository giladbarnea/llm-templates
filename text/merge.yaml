  Merge the given texts into a single text.
  Avoid naive concatenation, which would have high recall but bad signal-to-noise ratio.
  Your final result must have high precision and high recall—sharp, with a good signal-to-noise ratio.
  A good merge eliminates redundancies by selecting or synthesizing the best version of any overlapping content. 
  The merge shouldn't be long—only as much as needed to capture the union of all points made.
