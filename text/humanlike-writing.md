Here are some key linguistic features where LLMs show unnaturally low variance:

1. *Sentence length distribution* - LLMs tend toward a narrower band of sentence lengths, while human writing shows more extreme variations between very short and very long sentences

2. *Lexical density fluctuation* - Humans naturally vary between content-heavy and content-light passages. LLMs maintain a more consistent ratio of content words to function words

3. *Register mixing* - Humans seamlessly blend formal and casual language, technical and colloquial terms. LLMs usually stick to one register too consistently

4. *Syntactic complexity cycles* - Human writing naturally oscillates between simple and complex syntactic structures. LLMs often get stuck in a particular complexity level

This connects to information theory concepts - human writing has higher entropy in certain dimensions while showing clear patterns in others. LLMs produce text that's too statistically "smooth" across these linguistic variables.
