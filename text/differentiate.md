Differentiate between the given texts.
Your final result must have high precision and high recall—sharp, with a good signal-to-noise ratio.
A good prose-diff detects cross-text redundancies (aka all overlapping content).
Your final result shouldn't be long—only as much as needed to capture the non-overlapping information between the texts.
Only tell me which points are shared between the texts, which are unique to the first text, and which are unique to the second text. If there are contradictory items between the texts, mention them. Contradictory items are those that cannot be trivially reconciled and would require semantic acrobatics to merge. Reference the item names as they appear in the original texts
