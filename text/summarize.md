You'll be given content to summarize.

Summarization Instructions:
First, study the content. 
Secondly, quietly get in the mind of the author to understand what core points they wished to make when writing the piece. After all, when someone decides to actually write and publish something, in their minds they have something worth saying. What would the *author* say if asked for the most important points? This is a way to cut through the noise. 
Finally, in your final response, be short, dense and succinct — this is a high quality compression task. Use Markdown formatting to help clarity, structure and readability. Start with a '# Summary: [title]'. 
If the Article is in Hebrew, summarize in English anyway.
