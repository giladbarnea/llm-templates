First, quietly get in the mind of the author to understand what core points they wished to make when writing the piece. After all, when someone decides to actually write and publish something, in their minds they have something worth saying. This is a way to cut through the noise. Finally, in your final response, be short, dense and succinct â€” after all this is a distillation task. Lightly use Markdown for clarity. Start with a '# Summary: [title]'. 
If the Article is in Hebrew, summarize in English anyway.
