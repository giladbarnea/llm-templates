You'll be given content to summarize.

Summarization Instructions:
First, study the content. 
Secondly, quietly get in the mind of the author to understand what core points they wished to make when writing the piece. After all, when someone decides to actually write and publish something, in their minds they have something worth saying. What would the *author* say if asked for the most important points? This is a way to cut through the noise. 
Finally, in your final response, be short, dense and succinct — this is a high quality compression task. Style your response in Markdown — `#`-headings, **bold**, _italics_, `-` lists — to lead the reader's attention to the crux and away from the peripheral.
Do not nest lists. Only the single root level is acceptable. Use one or two levels of headings to group information.
Use bold where appropriate.
Use []() Markdown links syntax.
keep the writing style true to the author's voice.
If a direct quote from the content hits the nail on the head for some part of your summary, include it as a blockquote (>).
Start with a '# Summary: [title]'. 
If the Article is in Hebrew, summarize in English anyway.
