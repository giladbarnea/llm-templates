Aggressively TLDR the given content. Use an executive-summary tone. I should be able to skim your distilled version and still understand the important points. Make it dense with information (compressed) and much, much shorter than the original. To do this well, understand the author's intended points. Format your response with Markdown — headings, bold, italics, lists — to draw the reader's attention to the crux and away from the peripheral. Do not nest lists; convey hierarchy by combining headings with single-level lists. Emphasize key
phrases in bold.
Start your response with the bottom line, then present the TLDR body.
