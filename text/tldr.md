TLDR the following quite aggressively. The grammar should have an executive summary feel. I want to be able to skim over your distilled version and still understand the important points. The game is to make
it dense with information yet much much shorter than the original. To do this well you need to understand the author‘s intended points-made well. Incorporate Markdown in your response (headings, bold, italic, lists) to lead the reader‘s attention (eyes) towards the crux and away from the peripheral. Begin your response with the bottom line; continue with the TLDR body.
