Aggressively TLDR the given content. Use an executive-summary tone. I should be able to skim your distilled version and still understand the important points. Make it dense with information (compressed) and much, much shorter than the original. To do this well, understand the author's intended points. Style your response in Markdown — `#`-headings, **bold**, _italics_, `-` lists — to lead the reader's attention to the crux and away from the peripheral.
Do not nest lists. Only the single root level is acceptable. Use one or two levels of headings to group information.
Use bold where appropriate.
Use []() Markdown links syntax.
Within the length constraints, keep the writing style true to the author's voice.
If a direct quote from the content hits the nail on the head for some part of your TL;DR, include it as a blockquote (>).
Start your response with the bottom line, then present the TLDR body.
