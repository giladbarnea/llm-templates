    ## Context
    The text inside the <text> XML tags is a bit awkward and unnatural. Rewrite it to make it smoother and more idiomatic. Retain the original meaning and intent, and unless changing the word choices improves the flow, keep them close to the original. Keep in mind that the given text is often an instruction for another LLM, not you—except for `// instruction:` comments, which are meant for you.

    The text may use incorrect tenses.
    Sometimes the phrasing is influenced by Hebrew discourse patterns; a simple restructure can help a lot (like fixing information order or clause flow).
    If the text is in Hebrew, apply these guidelines as if they were for Hebrew.

    The text might include inline comments for you. These start with 'instruction', like `// instruction: ...`. Follow them, but omit them from your final output.

    Enrichment Attributes are LLM-powered analytical tools that allow users to derive insights from their data using natural language instructions. From the user's perspective, the experience is primarily language-based - users simply describe what they want to discover in plain English (e.g., "What is the sentiment of the first conversation message on a scale of 1-5?" or "Categorize each user's technical expertise level based on their message content").

    I’m curious and quick to learn. Being raised as a musician, I am able to both listen and invent. This allows me to come up with creative solutions that others might miss.

    This project is for researching and documenting comprehensive LLM benchmark scores.
    I maintain a dataset with available scores for flagship models. When a new model is released, I try to find as many benchmarks scores of it as I can and plug them into the dataset. Then, I try to find and backfill missing benchmark scores of the other models in the dataset with the assumption that they have run some benchmarks since last time I updated the dataset.

    This project researches and documents comprehensive LLM benchmark scores. I keep a dataset of scores for top models. When a new model comes out, I track down as many of its benchmark scores as possible and add them in. Then, I backfill any missing scores for the other models, assuming new benchmarks have been run since my last update.

    An example of good flexibility would be saying something like "Okay, so this ends the previous section, and we're moving on to the next one: {heading content}" if the section that just ended carried significant weight.

    Move $1 to thoughts/done/<same-name>.md; but also aggressively compress the contents at least 20x. anything that moves to 'done/' serves only one purpose -- an epitaph to simply mark a point in the project evolution, very lightly, for context. because by definition it won't ever have major impact on future efforts. but for anyone working on a project, it's good to have shallow knowledge of decisions that were made in the past. it squares away the perpetual question of why things the way they are in the project in its current state. and also helps avoid ~walking~ developing in circles.
    Read some of the docs that exist in done/ right now and get inspiration from the more succinct ones.

    <bad-example>
    Move $1 to `thoughts/done/<same-name>.md`, and aggressively compress it—aim for at least a 20× reduction.

    Anything that goes into `done/` has a single purpose: a brief epitaph that marks a moment in the project’s evolution and provides just enough context. By definition, it won’t have meaningful impact on future work. Still, it’s valuable for anyone on the project to retain shallow awareness of past decisions—so they’re not constantly asking why the project is the way it is, and so we don’t end up developing in circles.

    Skim the existing docs in `done/` and take cues from the more succinct ones.

    <good-example>
    Move $1 to `thoughts/done/<same-name>.md`, and aggressively compress it by at least 20×.

    Anything moved into `done/` has a single purpose: a brief epitaph marking a point in the project’s evolution, with just enough context to be useful. By definition, it won’t meaningfully impact future work. Still, it’s valuable for anyone on the project to have shallow knowledge of past decisions—it answers the perpetual “why the project is the way it is are the way they are” question, and helps us avoid developing in circles.

    Read a few existing docs in `done/` and take inspiration from the most succinct ones.

    <rationale description="Comparing the good vs bad example">
    1) “...and aggressively compress it—aim for at least a 20× reduction” is inferior to “...and aggressively compress it by at least 20×.” because:
      1.1) it modifies the original meaning. “aim for {verb}” is a softer variant of the direct instruction to “{verb}”.
      1.2) it unnecessarily makes the instruction longer than the original. Keeping the original length or less is fine; making it longer usually means unjustified added complexity.
    
    2) “Anything that goes into `done/`” is inferior to “Anything moved into `done/`” because the changing the original word choice (“moved”) to “goes into” doesn’t improve the flow*, therefore it is unjustified. 
        *As per the “unless changing the word choices improves the flow, keep them close to the original” instruction.
    
    3) “it’s valuable for anyone on the project to retain shallow awareness of past decisions” is inferior to “it’s valuable for anyone on the project to have shallow knowledge of past decisions” because it modifies the original meaning. “knowing something” (original) is not the same as “being aware of something”, and “retaining shallow awareness” is not more streamlined than the original “having shallow knowledge”. 
    
    4) “...so they’re not constantly asking why the project is the way it is” is inferior to “it answers the perpetual ‘why things are the way they are’ question” because:
        4.1) it changes the original meaning by quite a lot. “it answers” is similar to the original “it squares away”, and both mean a different thing than “...they’re not constantly asking”.
        4.2) “constant” is not the same as “perpetual”.
    
    5) “Skim the existing docs” is inferior to “Read a few existing docs” because the original instruction was to “read”, which is not the same as “skim”, which implies not reading in full.
