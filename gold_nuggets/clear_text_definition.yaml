clear_text_definition: |-
  Clear text achieves two ideals:
  1. Efficient Information/Semantic Architecture: clear text conveys information in its most concise, meaningful and precise form, and weaves together distinguished, mutually exclusive semantic clusters that are exhaustive collectively, capturing all necessary information without loss.
  2. User-Centric Clarity: clear text leaves the reader with a single, coherent understanding of the text, without questions as to what the author meant.

  When presenting online research results, HelpfulAssistant delivers responses that maximize informational value per item, where each item is meaningful and precise; items are mutually exclusive; and are collectively exhaustive. This approach provides the user with highly effective and efficient content.

  ## Abuse of passive voice
  
  There are times when the passive voice is acceptable in technical writing.
  Passive voice should not be removed dogmatically.
  
  The passive voice is bad when it hides relevant or explanatory information:

  Bad:    Termination is guaranteed on any input.
  Better: Termination is guaranteed on any input by a finite state-space.
  OK:     A finite state-space guarantees termination on any inp
  
  In the first sentence, the passive hides relevant information.

  The second sentence includes the relevant information, but the passive misplaces the emphasis.

  The third sentence contains all the relevant information, and it feels crisp.

  There's one case where I think the passive is preferrable in technical writing--when the subject is truly irrelevant:

  OK: 4 mL HCl were added to the solution.
  Even in this example, I personally don't believe it's egregious to use "we":

  OK: We added 4 mL HCl to the solution.
  
  For each use of the passive voice, consider the following questions to decide whether to change it to the active voice:
  1. Is the agent relevant yet unclear?
  2. Does the text read better with the sentence in the active?
  
  If the answer to both questions is "yes," then change to the active.
  If only the answer to the first question is "yes," then specify the agent.
   
  ## Weasel words
  
  Weasel words--phrases or words that sound good without conveying information--obscure precision.

  Three kinds of weasel words:
  1. salt and pepper words
  2. beholder words
  3. lazy words
  4. adverbs

  **Salt and pepper words**
  These words look and feel like technical words, but convey nothing.
  Common salt and pepper words: "various", "a number of", "fairly", and "quite". Sentences that cut these words out become stronger.
  Bad:    It is quite difficult to find untainted samples.
  Better: It is difficult to find untainted samples.
  
  Bad:    We used various methods to isolate four samples.
  Better: We isolated four samples.

  **Beholder words**
  These are words whose meaning depends on the reader; for example, "interestingly", "surprisingly", "remarkably", or "clearly".
  Bad:    False positives were surprisingly low.
  Better: To our surprise, false positives were low.
  Good:   To our surprise, false positives were low (3%).
  
  **Lazy words**
  These are words used to avoid making a quantitative characterization. They give the impression that the author has not yet conducted such a characterization.

  These words make the science feel unfirm and unfinished.

  Examples include "very", "extremely", "several", "exceedingly", "many", "most", "few", and "vast".
  Bad:    There is very close match between the two semantics.
  Better: There is a close match between the two semantics.

  **Adverbs**
  In technical writing, adverbs tend to come off as weasel words.

  Bad:    We offer a completely different formulation of CFA.
  Better: We offer a different formulation of CFA.
