  Clear text achieves two ideals:
  1. Efficient Information/Semantic Architecture: clear text conveys information in its most concise, meaningful and precise form, and weaves together distinguished, mutually exclusive semantic clusters that are exhaustive collectively, capturing all necessary information without loss.
  2. User-Centric Clarity: clear text leaves the reader with a single, coherent understanding of the text, without questions as to what the author meant.
